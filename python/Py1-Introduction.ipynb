We will cover a few of the very basics of the Python language. Data science modules like Pandas and matplotlib will be covered in future sessions.\n",

    "3. via the system prompt (e.g. linux terminal, windows shell). \n",

    "Which ever way you run Jupyter, the notebook will be displayed in your web browser. You can read more about the options to run notebooks here:\n",
